# Bacteria-Alaska-Permafrost-Thaw

This repository contains details of the thaw incubation study conducted over an 8-week period, using six types of permafrost collected from various locations across Alaska. DNA was extracted at the start of the experiment and after an 8-week, four-stage thaw process, with temperature transitions at -3째C, 0째C, 3째C, and 6째C.
